This is my first HTML project while following along with The Odin Project. I'm using this course as a refresher as well as to further my front end development skills. I once was a jr. developer at Amazon (mostly back end in Java). However after my time there I took a long break to pursue other interests. Now I'm attemping to get back into the software developement world. 

In this specific project I got to brush up on my HTML skills by using common tags to display text, links, and images on my web pages. The end product is a simple recipe website that allows the user to view 3 dishes. The dish specific pages list the dishes ingredients and includes step by step instructions for making it. 

Anyways I'm looking forward to continuing with The Odin Project. Excited to continue to learn and grow as a developer.
